              Longhorn backup target has been unavailable for more than 5 minutes.
              This means backups cannot be created or accessed.

              Troubleshooting:
              1. Check TrueNAS NFS service status
              2. Verify network connectivity to backup target
              3. Check Longhorn manager logs: kubectl logs -n longhorn-system -l app=longhorn-manager

              Troubleshooting:
              1. Check backup logs: kubectl describe backup {{ $labels.backup }} -n longhorn-system
              2. Verify backup target connectivity
              3. Check available storage space on backup target
              4. Review Longhorn manager logs

              This means it has fewer replicas than desired.

              Actions:
              1. Check node health and storage capacity
              2. Verify network connectivity between nodes
              3. Consider manual replica rebuild

              This is a critical condition that may result in data loss.

              IMMEDIATE ACTIONS:
              1. Stop all applications using this volume
              2. Create emergency backup if possible
              3. Check Longhorn manager logs immediately
